              <br />
              When you submit content to TikTok through ManageTok, you retain
              ownership of your content. However, by submitting content, you
              grant TikTok a worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free,
              sublicensable, and transferable license to use, reproduce,

              business, including without limitation for promoting and
              redistributing part or all of the TikTok platform in any media
              formats and through any media channels. This license includes the
              right for TikTok to modify, adapt, and otherwise create derivative
              works based on your content, in order to transmit, display, and
              distribute it over computer networks, devices, service providers,

              <strong className="h4">Use of the TikTok API </strong>
              <br />
              <br />
              ManageTok uses the TikTok API to enable users to manage their
              TikTok accounts and access the functionalities of the TikTok
              platform. By using ManageTok, you agree to comply with the TikTok
              API Terms of Service in addition to the terms and conditions of
              this agreement. When you sign in to ManageTok with your TikTok
              account, ManageTok will request authorization to access your
              TikTok account. By granting authorization, you agree to allow
              ManageTok to access your TikTok account and make requests on your
              behalf using the TikTok API. These requests may include, but are
              not limited to, uploading videos, commenting on videos, following
              other users, and retrieving data about your TikTok account. You
              further acknowledge that ManageTok is not responsible for any loss
              or damage that may arise from the use of the TikTok API or any
              third-party API used in connection with ManageTok. ManageTok will
              only use the TikTok API for the purpose of enabling you to manage
              your TikTok account and access the functionalities of the TikTok
              platform. ManageTok will not use the TikTok API to access, store,
              or share any user data for any other purpose, and will only store
              data related to your use of ManageTok in accordance with our
              Privacy Policy.

              <strong className="h4">Data Collection and Privacy </strong>
              <br />
              <br />
              ManageTok collects certain information about users and their TikTok accounts in order
              to provide its services. This information may include user account
              details, content submission data, and other usage information
              related to the use of ManageTok. ManageTok values the privacy and
              security of its users, and as such, any data collected by
              ManageTok will be used solely for the purpose of providing its
              services to users. ManageTok will not distribute or sell any user
              data to third parties, nor will it use any data collected for any
              purpose other than providing its services. By using ManageTok,
              users consent to the collection and use of data as described in
              this section. Users may revoke this consent at any time by
              discontinuing the use of ManageTok. ManageTok requests user
              authorization upon sign-in of their TikTok account, which grants
              access for TikTok API Calls that make requests on behalf of the
              user. The data collected will be stored in accordance with
              applicable laws and regulations governing data privacy and
              security.

              <strong className="h4">Intellectual Property </strong>

              All content submitted through ManageTok and the TikTok API must comply with TikTok's Terms of
              Service and all applicable laws and regulations. ManageTok does
              not claim ownership of any content submitted through the app, as
              such content is the property of the TikTok user or TikTok, as
              applicable. All intellectual property rights associated with
              ManageTok, including but not limited to copyrights, trademarks,
              and patents, are the property of the app owner and are protected
              by applicable laws. You may not reproduce, modify, distribute, or
              otherwise use any of the app's intellectual property without prior
              written consent from the app owner. 
              <br />
              <br />
              <strong className="h4">Limitation of Liability </strong> 
              <br />
              <br />
              ManageTok and its affiliates, licensors, partners, and service
              providers shall not be liable to you for any indirect, incidental,
              consequential, special, or punitive damages, including without
              limitation, lost profits, data loss, or damages resulting from
              business interruption or lost business revenue, arising out of or
              in connection with your use of the app, even if ManageTok or its
              affiliates, licensors, partners, or service providers have been
              advised of the possibility of such damages. To the maximum extent
              permitted by applicable law, ManageTok and its affiliates,
              licensors, partners, and service providers disclaim all
              warranties, whether express or implied, including but not limited
              to, warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular
              purpose, and non-infringement. In no event shall ManageTok's or
              its affiliates', licensors', partners', or service providers'
              total liability to you for all damages exceed the amount you paid,
              if any, to use the app. You acknowledge and agree that ManageTok
              and its affiliates, licensors, partners, and service providers are
              not responsible for the conduct, whether online or offline, of any
              user of the app, and that you use the app at your own risk. Some
              jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of
              liability for incidental or consequential damages, so the above
              limitations may not apply to you. 
              <br />
              <br />
              <strong className="h4">Termination </strong> 
              <br />
              <br />
              ManageTok may terminate or suspend your access to the app at any time, with or

              immediately cease. You may also terminate your use of ManageTok at
              any time by contacting us to delete your account. Please note that
              account deletion is not an immediate process and may take some
              time to complete. Since ManageTok is a web application, it cannot
              be uninstalled. Instead, you can simply close your browser or log
              out of your account to stop using the app. Upon termination, all
              provisions of these terms which by their nature should survive
              termination, shall survive, including, without limitation,
              ownership provisions, warranty disclaimers, indemnity, and
              limitations of liability.
